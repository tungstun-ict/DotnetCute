Custom Utility to Throw Exceptions in ASP .NET Core.

## Installation 

### Dotnet CLI
```
dotnet add package Tungstun.Cute --version 1.0.0
```

### Package Manager
```
Install-Package Tungstun.Cute -Version 1.0.0
```

## How to use?
First we need to register the middleware in `Program.cs`.
```cs
// Program.cs

using DotnetCute.Middleware;

app.UseMiddleware<CuteMiddleWare>();
```

After registering, every (custom) exception that inherits from the `ResponseException` class will be caught in the middleware. A custom exception would look like this:

```cs
// SampleException.cs

using DotnetCute.Attributes;
using DotnetCute.Exceptions;

// Note that if no HttpResponseCode is specified, status code 400 (BadRequest) is used.
[HttpResponseCode(Code = HttpStatusCode.NotFound)]
public class SampleException : ResponseException
{
    public SampleException(string description, params string[] additional) 
        : base(description, additional) { }
}
```

A simple response generated by Cute looks like this:

```json
{
    "code": "Sample",
    "description": "This is a sample!",
    "additional": []
}	

```

### Additionial
The additional can be used to return any additional data to the client. All additionals given in the exception will convert to a list.
